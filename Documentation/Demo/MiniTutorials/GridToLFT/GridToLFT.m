%% Converting between LFT- and Grid-based LPV Systems
%
% LPVTools provides tools to convert a LFT-based LPV system into a
% grid-based LPV system, and vice versa. In this example we will showcase 
% the functionality of these tools. We will utilize
% them to take a grid-based LPV system and transform it into LFT-based 
% form to do control design. Finally, the LFT-based controller will be
% transformed into grid-based form for evaluation.

%% Define a Grid-Based LPV Model
%
% We have a LPV model $G(\rho)$:
%
% $$\begin{array}{l@{}l}
%  \dot{x}_G &{}= -\rho_1 x_G + \rho_2 u_G \\
%  y &{}= \rho_1*\rho_2 x_G 
% \end{array} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$ 
% 
% which is modeled as a grid-based LPV model using |pss| and |pgrid|
% objects:

% Define a time-varying real parameter. 
rho1 = pgrid('rho1',1:10,[-1 1]);
rho2 = pgrid('rho2',1:3,[-10 10]);

% Construct a grid-based LPV system:
P = ss(-rho1,rho2,rho1*rho2,0);

%% Converting a Grid-based LPV Model into a LFT-based LPV Model
% 
% Lets transform |P| from a grid-based LPV system into a LFT-based system. 
% This is accomplished using the function |grid2lft|, which 
% transforms a grid-based LPV model into a LFT-based LPV model by 
% approximating the parameter dependence of the underlying data 
% and expressing it as a rational function of the parameter, 
% which can then be rewritten in LFT form. 
% 
% A grid-based LPV system consists of an array of state-space models,
% arranged on a grid of parameter values. The current implementation of 
% |grid2lft| takes each element of these parameter dependent state-space 
% matrices and finds a polynomial function of the parameter, which captures 
% how that element changes as a function of the parameter. Once the array
% of state-space models has been replaced by a single state-space model 
% whose matrix elements are polynomial functions of the parameters, it can 
% be rewritten as a LFT.
% 
% The user can specify the desired form the the polynomial function used to
% fit the matrix elements. In this example we will use a polynomial of the
% form: (1,x,y,x^2,x*y,y^2) to fit the grid-based data. 
% 
% We will use |grid2lft| to transform |P| into a LFT-based 
% model |Plft|. The first argument to |grid2lft| is the grid-based model
% that will be approximated as a LFT. The second argument is the desired
% order of the polynomial used for the fit, in this case
% (1,x,y,x^2,x*y,y^2) corresponds to a second order polynomial, 
% so we put in the number 2:

% Transfrom P into a LFT model:
Plft = grid2lft(P,2)


%% LPV Design problem
% 
% We can define the control design problem as follows:

% Define and plot weights for synthesis problem
Wu = tf([10 10],[1 100]);
We = tf([1 25],[5 5]);
Wd = ss(0.1);

bodemag(Wu,'b',We,'r--')
legend('Wu','We')


%%
% Define a weighted interconnection for the synthesis problem
systemnames = 'Plft Wu We Wd';
inputvar = '[r; d; u]';
outputvar = '[We; Wu; r-Plft]';
input_to_We = '[r-Plft]';
input_to_Wu = '[u+Wd]';
input_to_Wd = '[d]';
input_to_Plft = '[Wu+u]';
Gweights = sysic

%% LFT-based LPV Synthesis
% We will use |lpvsyn| to synthesize the LFT controller:

% Perform LPV design with LFT approach
nmeas = 1;
ncont = 1;
[Klft,GammaLFT] = lpvsyn(Gweights,nmeas,ncont);

%% 
% The LFT-based controller |Klft| is guarenteed to acheive a induced 
% $L_2$ norm of |GammaLFT|:
GammaLFT

%% Convert LFT-Based System to Grid-Based System
% 
% We can transform the LFT controller into a grid-based LPV controller.
% This is accomplished using the |lft2grid| function. The process of
% transforming a LFT based system into a grid-based LPV system is simple:
% First, pick a desired grid of parameter values for the resulting
% grid-based system. Second, evaluate the LFT-based system at each grid
% point by replacing the time-varying parameter in the LFT, with a
% parameter values at each grid point. The resulting array of state-space
% models and assocaited grid of parameter values constitutes a grid-based
% LPV model approximation of the LFT-based model. Lets transform |Klft|
% into a grid-based LPV system.

% We will use the parameter grid from the original system P
Domain = P.Domain;

%%

% Transform Klft into a grid-based LPV system:
Kg = lft2grid(Klft,Domain)


%% 
% We transform the weighted interconnection |Gweights| into grid-based
% model, and compute the induced $L_2$ norm achieved by the grid-based
% version of the controller:

% Transform the  weighted interconnection into a grid-based system
GweightsGRID = lft2grid(Gweights,Domain)

%%

% Closed the loop around the controller and the weighted interconnection:
WeightedCL = lft(GweightsGRID,Kg)

%% 

% Compute the induced $L_2$ norm:
GammaGrid = lpvnorm(WeightedCL)

%%
% The induced $L_2$ norm computed for the grid-based
% version of the controller is substantially lower than the induced $L_2$ 
% norm computed for the LFT version. There are a few issues that can 
% explain this.
% First, the computed induced $L_2$ norm is in both cases only an upper
% bound, hence the results are not inconsistent. Second, the LFT-based
% LPV model is a smooth function of the parameter, and includes every
% intermediary parameter value between the grid points in |Domain| 
% (the grid of parameter values which underlies the grid-based LPV model). 
% The dynamics at these intermediary points was approximated from the
% existing grid-based model. Hence, if this approximation is inaccurate,
% the LFT-based analysis will be taking into account dynamics that are not
% really there.
